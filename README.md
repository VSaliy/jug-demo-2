jug-demo-2
==========

_Demo code #2 for Spring/Java User Group meetings Q4 2013_

Enhanced version of the web-application using Spring Boot from JUG Demo 1.
This project shows how to integrate a classic service layer and how to use
Spring Data JPA to implement a repository.

Most of the hard work is actually in the pom.xml.  Note that most of our online
examples now use the Gradle build tool (Gradle combines the best of Ant and
Maven and uses a Groovy based script DSL for configuration instead of XML).
